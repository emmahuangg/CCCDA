      <p class="texta">
      The Chinese Original Ballet “Mulan” is produced by Liaoning Ballet Group (Liaoning Ballet, or Liaoba)
     <br><br>
    The ballet drama Hua Mulan was staged in Canadian cities Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal in September 2019.
      <br><br>
    Produced by the Liaoning Ballet of China, it attempts to interpret the classic Chinese story of Hua Mulan through dance and music for contemporary audiences.
      <br><br>
    Mulan’s name originally appeared in the The Ballad of Mulan, an ancient Chinese poem composed based on the life story of Hua Mulan dating back to over 1000 years ago.  Mulan, the valiant daughter, volunteered to join the army on behalf of her ailing father to defend her country.  Despite her well-known military exploits, Hua Mulan excused herself from an official title and accolades, and returned to her hometown to live an ordinary life after the war.

      <p class="textb">
        In August 2019, CCCDA invited the theatre play "One Heart" to be performed in Vancouver and Toronto, Canada. The China Performing Arts Group organized the tour of the theatre drama.  Produced by Beijing Longmashe Culture Communication Co., Ltd., the play was written by the renowned playwrite Zou Jingzhi, and performed by  three famous actors Zhang Guoli, Wang Gang and Zhang Tielin.
        <br><br>
        "One Heart" tells a moving story of three strangers who run business in the historic Dongan trading market, and at the most trying time become friends with a tie as close as brothers during China's turbulent times at the end of the Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China.  But the three brothers, with contrasting personalities, are also very different in their way of life, about women, generosity, ambition, loyalty, business calculation, benevolence and righteousness.
        <br><br>
        To create this theatre drama, Mr. Zou Jingzhi devoted over ten years of his time, many versions of the script to enrich its unique Beijing colour, and the historical features.  The play was specially tailored to fit the three main characters, performed by the three actors, the so-called "iron triangle".

      <br><br>
      It is a cold rainy night with a bleak autumn wind. Ah Quei is beheaded for being a member of the Chinese Revolutionary Party, and his soul starts wandering through Weizhuang, the town where he lived before his death.
      <br><br>
      Feeling embittered, the spirit of the dead man looks back on his short life and tries to understand the cause of his miserable fate. He consults wise men, the noble lords in Weizhuang and his enemy, but they are unable to help. He is confused by his death and feels hatred towards the cold world.
      <br><br>
      The confused and angry spirit asks himself the same question, but doesn’t find an answer. He sighs helplessly, suspended in his life between Heaven and Earth. His ruminations on human nature turn into dreary, sorrowful rain.

      <h3 class="name3c">Golden Lotus Ballet: Eastern Madame Bovary and her Unfortunate Love<br><br>September, 2018</h3>
      <p class="text3c">
        Labeled by many as an infamous tale of sexual desires, the fascinating classic Chinese novel, Jin Ping Mei, made another mark in history with its world premiere Ballet Golden Lotus debut in Hong Kong. Now it is touring Canada.
        <br><br>
        With beautiful costumes and sets, rich traditional and contemporary music, and tight choreography, Ballet Golden Lotus tells the story of a 1500s Chinese “Madame Bovary” – Beauty Golden Lotus whose unfortunate love, with the tiger slayer Wu Sung, the high dignitary Xi Men Qin, and her humble peddler husband Wu Da, led her to a bloody desperate ending. Told in four acts, "Prelude," "Wu Sung," "Xi Men," and “Lian,” the dance drama's structure reflects the characters’ struggles in expressive passages of dance and music, through a wonderful combination of timelessness and a great deal of mystery, intrigue and the excitement of it being set in a time we didn't live in.
        <br><br>
        Adapting the most famous Chinese ancient erotica and presenting it to people from a prudish and sexually repressive culture, as the production was about to tour China after its great success in Hong Kong, it became the focus of fiery debate in the media - resulting in its prohibition throughout the country because of its controversial content. Tamed some scenes in order to pass muster, Golden Lotus was finally being staged on the mainland China, but three years after its debut in Hong Kong.
        <br><br>
        Golden Lotus, getting to the heart of its title character in an efficient 90 minutes, is a great and novel experience for theatre lover.

        <h5>​​03 Theatre Play “Tea House”</h5>
        <h3>+&nbsp;expand</h3>
        <p>The renowned Beijing People’s Arts Theatre performed the famous contemporary Chinese theatre play “Tea House” in Toronto and Vancouver.   “Tea House” is the masterpiece creation by the renowned late Chinese playwright and novelist Lao She.  “Tea House” is one of the most performed Chinese plays around the world, a signature production of the Beijing People’s Art Theatre.  The play, which was staged over half a century ago, is a social and cultural commentary on the problems and changes in China during the early twentieth century.  Since 1956, “Tea house” has performed over 600 times, including those that were successfully staged in France, Switzerland, Hamburg and many other countries.
        <br><br>
        Set in an old tea house in downtown Beijing, the play is typical of Lao She's art style that seeks to provide a panoramic view of Chinese history and culture in their transformation from tradition to modernity. “Tea house” spans fifty years in modern Chinese history from the collapse of the Qing dynasty and the Republican Revolution to the birth of the People's Republic. The play brings together over sixty characters, representing all walks of life.  It is noted for its vivid portrayal of characters and lively use of Beijing dialect, but its main thrust lies in Lao She's vision of history, which is prophetic of later political movements and its disastrous effects on the ordinary Chinese people.  The tea house in the ancient capital of Beijing was a witness and a microcosm of the times.
        <br><br>
        The artists also participated in seminars on Chinese culture, theatre and literary arts at the University of Toronto and the University of British Columbia.</p>

        <p>​MONTRÉAL EN LUMIÈRE is one of the largest winter festivals in the world, an annual celebration registering 1 300,000 festival site visits from fans experiencing the joy of Montreal wintertime through a unique program combining performing arts, gastronomy, free outdoor family activities, and a full night of exquisitely original discoveries!
        ​<br><br>
        As part of the 2015-2016 People-to-People Culture Exchange between Canada and China, the Chinese city Shenzhen is featured during this festival.  The featured international city at MONTRÉAL EN LUMIÈRE this year, Shenzhen ranks among the wealthiest and most populous cities in China, with some 11 million inhabitants. Located in Southern China’s Guangdong Province, the municipality was still largely rural in the 1970s, but has experienced spectacular economic and demographic growth to now figure among the country’s most flourishing urban areas. Today, Shenzhen is a leading city in the arts, culture, tourism, innovation, and music, with its globally renowned symphony orchestra, and cosmopolitan gastronomy at the crossroads of different culinary influences.
        <br><br>
        Shenzhen food not only inherited the tradition of Cantonese Cuisine, one of China’s four major cuisines but also absorbed the essence of almost all the local cuisines in China, as well as the essence of Japanese, South Korean, Southeast Asian, French and Italian food. Furthermore, it develops into various types of food which can better fit modern urban people’s eating habits, and is more nutritious, delicious and of fine artistic design. At MONTRÉAL EN LUMIÈRE, famous chefs from Futian Shangri-La Hotel and Grand Mercure Oriental Ginza Hotel will present the essence of Shenzhen food.
        <br><br>
        And like Montreal, Shenzhen, a member of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network since 2008, has also been recognized as a UNESCO City of Design. That’s why a collaboration between MONTRÉAL EN LUMIÈRE and Shenzhen was absolutely natural, and the Montreal event will unveil plenty of surprises from China throughout its different programs: gastronomy, the arts, and on the free outdoor site!</p>
